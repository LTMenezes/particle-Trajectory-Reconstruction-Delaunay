# Particle Trajectory Reconstruction - Voronoi

## About this project

This is a new particle trajectory reconstruction approach, using Voronoi diagrams to assist clusterization of tracklets, aiming for performance and parallelism.

Code is designed for the LHCb, but can easily be extended for solving similar problems.
